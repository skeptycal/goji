package goji // import "github.com/skeptycal/goji"

Package goji is a minimalistic and flexible HTTP request multiplexer.

Goji itself has very few features: it is first and foremost a standard set
of interfaces for writing web applications. Several subpackages are
distributed with Goji to provide standard production-ready implementations
of several of the interfaces, however users are also encouraged to implement
the interfaces on their own, especially if their needs are unusual.

type Mux struct{ ... }
    func NewMux() *Mux
    func SubMux() *Mux
type Pattern interface{ ... }
